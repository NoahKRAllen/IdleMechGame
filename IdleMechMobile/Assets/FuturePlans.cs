/*
 *Current Future Plans in Place:
 *1) Removal of Matter Button, converting to only generating with cycles
 *2) Update upgrade screen, no longer will it be a matter upgrade, it will be the miner mech upgrades, with each miner giving +1 matter per cycle
 *2a) Extra upgrades to increase the productivity of each miner
 *2b) Visual on main screen to see how many miner have been bought, eventually with models in the background to show
 *2c) Deeper upgrades on miner screen, allowing for automated creation of miners, both with auto buying with matter and with expensive machinery shops to make miners each cycle
 *3) Possibly have an entirely different upgrade screen for the buildings to auto build mechs, can be expanded with each mech type added later
 *4) Get the visual mechs imported in so I have something nice to look at while testing
 *5) Continue uploading this to github every time I finished a day off
